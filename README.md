### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I haven't embarked on any amazing side-projects recently, however I have made contributions to a few open-source projects that I'm quite proud of.

#### SerenityOS (C++)

> SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.

During 2020 and 2021 I [made contributions](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anvella) to the [SerenityOS project](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) in my spare time, primarily focusing on the graphical user interface components. Of note;

- [I proposed, designed and implemented a general-purpose graphical 'wizard' framework for the easy inclusion of multi-page graphical walkthroughs into other system applications.](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/5534)
- [I proposed, designed and implemented a 'New Project' dialog for the in-built integrated development environment.](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/5213)

#### Open Live Writer (.NET Framework, WinForms)

[Open Live Writer](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter) is the open-source continuation of the popular 'Windows Live Writer' blog authoring app for Windows. During late 2019, I [maintained and contributed to the project](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anvella+) in my spare time, fixing bugs and implementing new features to make the software more fit for purpose in the modern blogging environment. Of note;

- [I designed and implemented a simple, but extensible support for external static site generators.](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/pull/844)
- [I (temporarily) fixed Google Blogger image upload.](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/pull/810)
- [I designed and implemented a modern splash screen for the application.](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/pull/850)
